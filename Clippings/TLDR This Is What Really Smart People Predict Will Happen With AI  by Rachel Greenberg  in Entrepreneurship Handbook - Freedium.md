Most conversations about AI split into two camps:

- The optimists, who think AI will usher in a golden age of abundance.
- The doomers, who think AI will end humanity as we know it.

But there's a third prediction (posited by some of the smartest minds on earth, including ones with a backdoor view into AI development that gives them exponentially more insight than the layperson). This is a viewpoint people tend to avoid because it's both optimistic *and* deeply inconvenient.

It goes like this: Over the next 12 to 15 years, things are going to get a lot messier. AI will be powerful enough to replace millions of jobs (no shocker), rewrite industries (old news), and make entire career paths irrelevant almost overnight (well, duh…).

That was the "no brainer" part of the prediction — but this is the part you probably haven't heard yet: After more than a decade of economic turbulence, political catch-up, and people fighting to "compete" with machines that outthink them in milliseconds, we'll reach a breaking point. Humans will stop pretending they can win the productivity race, and society will agree on a **new social contract** — including a Universal Basic Income (UBI), which is essentially a guaranteed paycheck from the government whether you work or not.

To be clear, that UBI isn't so much to make things fair, but rather to prevent slowing national (or global) productivity by artificially encouraging workforces that do things the old, inefficient human way.

Only then — once survival is no longer tied to your ability to earn — will we get the so-called AI "utopia" everyone's been promised. Imagine a world where the stress of making your mortgage payment, clocking in and out of a grueling 9 to 5, and somehow making time for some semblance of a family or social life weren't three perpetual constraints. Sounds nice in theory, right? But here's the part no one emphasizes: **you do not want to be broke during those first 15 years before we get there.**

Whether you're a business owner, a serial or aspiring entrepreneur, or just a forward-looking person wondering [where best to allocate your time and resources for a fruitful future](https://ehandbook.com/the-ai-era-entrepreneur-nobody-wants-to-hire-but-everyones-accidentally-becoming-50551043f792), you're going to want to keep reading…

### The Mo Gawdat Window (And Why It's Closing)

Former Google X exec Mo Gawdat has a version of this timeline. His prediction: Once AI surpasses human-level intelligence — *and he believes we're already halfway there* — the rate of change will become exponential.

[That acceleration will be thrilling for innovators and brutal for everyone else.](https://ehandbook.com/non-entrepreneurs-will-hate-me-for-saying-this-but-its-true-0e4de6b7f761)

In the early years of that curve, *humans* will still run human systems — governments, financial institutions, labor laws — but AI will be powerful enough to shrink industries by 50% in less than two years. Think about what happened to taxi drivers when Uber launched — then multiply that speed and scope by a hundred. *But make it worse: Instead of new job opportunities (like the ones Uber created), imagine Uber drivers replaced by AI (a.k.a. self-driving cars).*

This is the window we're talking about — the last decade or so before AI reshapes the economy so radically that most traditional paths to wealth are gone. If you don't use it to stack assets, you risk entering the turbulence years with nothing to leverage.

I've been through my own much smaller "Mo Gawdat window" moments. In one former startup, I saw an entire revenue model crumble within a year because a social media-adjacent marketplace ecosystem imploded overnight (think the rapid death of MCNs). We pivoted fast, but not fast enough to save the margin we'd built our projections on. Despite having an entire roster of A-list talent signed to our startup, we couldn't overcome an industry-wide economic shift. AI will make those kinds of hits happen faster, harder, and in more industries at once.

### The Myth of "AI-Proof" Industries

Every time AI makes headlines, LinkedIn fills up with lists of *"jobs AI can't replace."* Teachers. Therapists. Plumbers.

They're comforting. And almost entirely wrong.

History says the safest industries aren't "safe" forever. In the early 1900s, the horse and carriage industry was massive. Then cars made it obsolete in a decade. In the 1990s, everyone assumed oil would dominate for centuries. Now, AI-powered energy research is exploring alternatives that could push fossil fuels toward extinction.

The truth: *AI will eventually touch — and likely disrupt — almost everything.* Even the areas we think it "needs" today, like massive data centers or certain energy sources, can be redesigned, re-engineered, or made obsolete by AI itself.

That's the tricky part. Betting on current "AI dependencies" — like powering data farms — might give you a short burst of returns, but AI's ability to innovate new solutions means [your moat could disappear in a fraction of the time it would have taken](https://ehandbook.com/the-moment-i-quit-any-business-and-when-you-should-too-6508ed57e9fe) in the pre-AI economy.

I've made this mistake on a smaller scale. I once invested in tools and services that seemed like permanent bottlenecks for my industry — until a new platform replaced them entirely, and every dollar I'd sunk into those "safe" dependencies was locked in custom platforms and bespoke software no one wanted to buy. The lesson? *Even your "defensive" plays can be temporary.*

### What AI Can't (Or Won't) Replace

So if "AI-proof" is a myth, where should you focus? The goal isn't finding a forever-safe industry *(good luck with that — though maybe ask AI for advice?)*. Really though, the more prudent and viable pursuit is [identifying assets with a long enough lifespan](https://ehandbook.com/founders-you-have-no-clue-what-youre-up-against-eeddca039d4e) to get you through the turbulence — ideally ones that gain value during the transition. Some examples:

#### Physical facilities for human-driven ventures:

- Commercial kitchens for food startups (which still have to comply with health and safety laws).
- Clinical-grade labs for beauty or healthcare testing (where regulatory compliance is non-negotiable).
- Audio-visual studios, creative spaces, or boutique manufacturing hubs.

#### Specialized regulatory infrastructure:

AI can design a skincare formula in seconds, but it can't physically submit your trial to the FDA, manage a human ethics committee, or sign a compliance form. Owning the spaces or services that bridge those gaps is valuable.

#### Human-centered services:

No matter how advanced AI gets, some people will still pay extra for in-person, high-trust, high-status interactions: concierge medical care, luxury travel planning, elite athletic coaching.

#### Physical goods with provenance:

Even in a world run by machines, humans value origin stories. A handcrafted whisky from a century-old distillery will still sell — maybe more so when most goods are machine-made.

### The Asset Test (Ask This Before Spending a Dime)

Here's the question I keep asking myself about any business or investment right now: ***Will this still matter when nobody has to work for survival?***

If the answer's no, it's a short-term play — fine for generating cash flow now, but don't pretend it's your forever plan.

If the answer's yes, you've found something with *post-UBI* value — meaning it will still hold demand once everyone's basic income needs are met and work becomes optional.

Think about it:

- **Data centers?** AI might invent a more efficient way to process and store information that makes them obsolete.
- **Luxury wellness retreats?** Even when money's not tied to survival, people will still seek status-driven, human-led experiences.

The reason this question matters is because it forces you to zoom out beyond the next five years. I learned this the hard way when I once built an entire business model around a high-demand niche that disappeared as soon as regulations shifted. Had I asked this question back then, I would have seen the short half-life before committing the capital. I'm sure countless people who built multi-million-dollar Covid cash-grabs ([like the $3M-funded UV mask kickstarter](https://www.tcf.team/blog/how-we-raised-5m-for-uvmask-on-kickstarter-and-indiegogo-in-6-months)) learned the same.

### Don't Just Own. Control.

Ownership is good. Control is better.

If AI can generate anything, the real power lies in **gateways** — the choke points AI *still* has to go through, at least for now.

That means:

- **Own the infrastructure:** If 50 brands need a licensed production facility, own the facility. AI can't bypass food safety laws or health inspections — at least not until governments rewrite the rules entirely (which historically takes years or decades).
- **Own the distribution:** Even if AI can optimize routes, secure drivers, or manage fleets, *someone* still has to physically hold the contracts with carriers, control the warehouse space, and decide who gets priority. Those decisions — and that real estate — can't be conjured out of thin air.
- **Own the permits:** Licensing and regulatory approvals don't transfer easily. AI could make the permitting process faster, but in most industries, the *holder* of the permit matters more than how quickly it's obtained. Until governments issue permits to non-human entities, those approvals remain a uniquely human-controlled bottleneck.

When [I was setting up my newest frozen food startup's production](https://ehandbook.com/6-shocking-things-ive-learned-about-building-a-new-startup-in-a-highly-regulated-industry-83e4f9366afb), I realized the real value wasn't just the brand or recipe — it was having CDFA-approved facilities. You can't download that from ChatGPT. It takes paperwork, inspections, the right equipment, and compliance — and that's exactly why owning those kinds of assets creates a barrier AI can't bulldoze in an afternoon.

### Two Wild Cards You're Not Planning For

Here's where the predictions get stranger — but if you're building wealth in the AI era, you need to be ready for them.

**Wild Card #1: Post-Scarcity Housing** If AI cracks fully automated construction and material synthesis, we could see high-quality homes built in weeks for a fraction of today's cost. That could nuke entire real estate markets — not because housing wouldn't be valuable, but because scarcity would evaporate.

- **Caveat:** People will still pay a premium for unique locations, historic properties, or neighborhoods with cultural cachet. "Scarcity" might shift from *type* of housing to *location-based desirability*.

**Wild Card #2: Instant-Obsolete Industries** AI could invent solutions that wipe out entire sectors in a single product cycle. Imagine an AI-engineered "nutrition patch" that gives you all your daily calories and micronutrients — deliciously — without farming, packaging, or distribution. Entire agricultural and food manufacturing ecosystems could vanish in under a decade (taking multi-generational businesses with them and reducing their assets to a fraction of their former value).

- **Caveat:** Even if such technology existed, humans are cultural creatures, so of course, many would still want the experience of eating, social dining, and artisan-made food. That means parts of the industry would survive — but at a smaller, more niche, possibly luxury scale.
- Further, this development could actually create new global opportunities to prevent world hunger, which could create the need for more purpose-driven ventures to solve problems that were previously deemed impossible or prohibitively expensive. This is where [human innovation can harness the AI "disruption"](https://ehandbook.com/the-founder-superpower-no-one-talks-about-but-its-why-you-ll-win-6c3b6ec13c2e) and contribute to that future "utopia" that might be within arms' reach.

Either way, keeping a finger on the pulse of these changes is crucial for both strategic resource allocation today and uncovering the new business opportunities of tomorrow.

### Survive the Chaos, Own the Calm

If Mo Gawdat's right, we're headed for AI utopia — eventually. [But first, we'll live through AI purgatory](https://ehandbook.com/the-business-killer-no-one-talks-about-until-it-costs-them-millions-b6547763a424).

Your job isn't to beat AI. It's to outlast the years where humans are still running broken human systems while AI is making them obsolete. That means:

- Buying, building, or controlling assets AI can't instantly replace.
- Focusing on things that matter in a post-work society.
- Acting before the herd sees what's coming.

In my experience, the entrepreneurs who win in times like these aren't the ones with the best ideas — they're the ones who see the storm coming and buy the lifeboats early. Fifteen years from now, you'll either be watching AI run the world from a position of comfort and control — or wondering why you thought you had more time.
