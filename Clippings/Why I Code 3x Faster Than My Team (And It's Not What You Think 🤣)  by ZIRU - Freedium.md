## Why I Code 3x Faster Than My Team (And It's Not What You Think ðŸ¤£)

## The secret isn't better tools or more experienceâ€Šâ€”â€Šit's knowing when "good enough" actually is good enough

You know that feeling when your manager asks for an ETA and you think "two weeks" but say "three weeks just to be safe"? Yeah, I used to do that too. Then I watched my deadlines slip anyway because I kept polishing code that nobody would ever read.

Last year, I started tracking my development speed compared to my teammates. The results surprised me. I was consistently shipping features 3x faster than developers with similar experience. But here's the weird part â€” I wasn't working longer hours or using fancy AI tools that everyone talks about.

I was just doing everything wrong. At least, wrong according to everything I learned in computer science classes.

### The Problem With "Perfect" Code

When I started coding, I thought every function needed to be perfectly tested. Every variable name had to be elegant. Every abstraction needed to be crystal clear. I wanted zero bugs and beautiful architecture.

This sounds good in theory. But in practice, it made me incredibly slow.

Here's what actually happens when you chase perfection. You spend three hours naming a variable that gets deleted next week. You build an elegant abstraction for a feature that never gets the second use case you planned for. You write comprehensive tests for code that turns out to solve the wrong problem.

I learned this lesson the hard way during a 24-hour hackathon. My team spent 18 hours building a "clean" solution while the winning team had working software after 6 hours. Their code was messy, full of TODO comments, and probably had bugs. But it worked, and that's all that mattered.

The lightbulb moment: **Different projects need different quality standards.**

For a pacemaker, every line needs to be perfect because lives depend on it. For a weekend side project, it just needs to work well enough to validate your idea. Most projects fall somewhere in between.

Now I ask myself one question before I start coding: "What's good enough for this project?"

Sometimes good enough means 60% quality if I'm testing an idea. Sometimes it means 95% quality if I'm building something customers pay for. But it's almost never 100% because perfect is the enemy of shipped.

### The Magic of Rough Drafts

Writers don't start with perfect prose. They write terrible first drafts, then edit them into something good. But somehow in programming, we think we should write perfect code on the first try.

This is backwards.

My rough draft code looks terrible. It has bugs. Tests fail. There are TODO comments everywhere. I copy-paste code instead of making it DRY. I hardcode values that should be variables. I leave print statements for debugging.

But here's why this approach works: **rough drafts reveal the unknown unknowns.**

When you try to write perfect code from the start, you're making decisions based on incomplete information. You don't know which parts will be hard. You don't know which features will change. You don't know what the real bottlenecks are.

Rough drafts show you these things quickly.

Last month, I was building a data processing pipeline. My first instinct was to design a beautiful, flexible architecture that could handle any data format. Instead, I wrote a messy script that just handled our current data. It took 2 hours instead of 2 days.

Good thing too, because the requirements changed completely the next week.

The rough draft revealed that performance was actually the biggest concern, not flexibility. If I had spent days on the "perfect" architecture, I would have optimized for the wrong thing.

My process now:

1. Write the ugliest code that solves the problem
2. Make sure it actually works
3. Identify what parts need to be cleaned up
4. Refactor only what matters

This doesn't mean I ship rough drafts. It means I use rough drafts to understand the problem before I build the real solution.

### Question Everything (Especially Requirements)

Here's something nobody tells you: most requirements are negotiable.

Product managers and clients often ask for complex features because they haven't thought through simpler alternatives. They want 10 different screens when 2 would work fine. They want to handle edge cases that affect 0.1% of users.

I used to just build whatever was asked. Now I ask questions:

"Can we combine these two screens?" "Do we really need to handle this edge case?" "What if we supported 10 items instead of 1000?" "Could we launch with a simpler version first?"

Half the time, the answer is yes.

Last quarter, I was asked to build a complex reporting dashboard with 15 different chart types. Instead of building it, I asked, "What decisions are you trying to make with this data?"

It turned out they really just needed to know if sales were going up or down. One simple line chart solved the actual problem in a fraction of the time.

**The fastest code is code you don't have to write.**

I'm not saying ignore requirements. I'm saying understand the goal behind the requirements. Often you can achieve the same goal with much less work.

### Focus Is Your Superpower

The biggest productivity killer isn't slow typing or bad tools. It's distraction.

You start fixing a bug and notice some ugly code nearby. You refactor it. Then you see an opportunity to improve the naming. Then you realize this whole module could be organized better. Before you know it, you've spent four hours and the original bug is still there.

I call this "productivity theater." You feel busy, but you're not making progress on what actually matters.

Here's what changed my life: **timers and tiny commits.**

Now I set a 25-minute timer for every task. When it goes off, I stop and commit whatever I have, even if it's not perfect. This forces me to focus on the essential part first.

The timer creates urgency. Instead of wandering into refactoring land, I stay focused on the specific problem I'm solving. If there's time left over, then I can clean things up.

Tiny commits also help because they create momentum. Every commit feels like progress. And if I do get distracted, the timer catches me and brings me back.

The weird side effect: my code quality actually improved. When you have limited time, you focus on what really matters instead of what might possibly matter someday.

### Small Steps, Big Results

I used to save up changes into big commits. I thought it was more professional to ship complete features instead of incremental progress.

This was another mistake.

Big changes are hard to review. They're risky to deploy. They take forever to complete, which means no feedback until the very end. And if something goes wrong, it's hard to figure out what broke.

Small changes are the opposite. They're easy to review, safe to deploy, and give you feedback quickly. If something breaks, you know exactly what caused it.

But the biggest benefit is psychological. Small changes create momentum. Every merged pull request feels like progress. You stay motivated because you're constantly shipping.

My rule now: **if a change is working, ship it, even if it's not complete.**

Instead of building a whole feature behind a feature flag, I ship the backend first, then the API, then the frontend. Each piece works and adds value, even though the complete feature isn't done yet.

This approach has a bonus: it forces you to design better APIs. When you can't hide messy interfaces behind "we'll fix it later," you naturally create cleaner boundaries between components.

### The Skills That Actually Matter

All of this strategy stuff is nice, but some technical skills make you genuinely faster:

**Reading code** is probably the most underrated skill. When you can quickly understand existing code, debugging becomes much easier. You spend less time guessing and more time fixing. You also learn faster by seeing how other people solve problems.

**Data modeling** is worth going slow for. A bad database design or data structure will haunt you for months. It's one of the few areas where investing extra time upfront saves massive amounts of time later.

**Scripting** makes everything faster. I write tiny bash and Python scripts constantly. Converting data formats, generating boilerplate code, finding duplicates, cleaning up files. If I'm doing something more than twice, I script it.

**Using debuggers** instead of print statements saves hours. I know print debugging feels faster, but actual debuggers let you explore the problem space instead of guessing where to put the next print statement.

**Taking breaks** when stuck. This sounds obvious, but it's hard to do. I've lost count of problems that seemed impossible at 5 PM but had obvious solutions at 9 AM the next day.

### The Real Secret

Here's what I learned after years of trying to code faster: **speed comes from making fewer mistakes, not from typing faster.**

The bottleneck isn't your keyboard speed or your knowledge of shortcuts. It's making good decisions about what to build and when to stop.

Perfect code that solves the wrong problem is worthless. Messy code that solves the right problem is valuable.

So start with rough drafts. Question the requirements. Stay focused on what matters. Ship small changes frequently. And remember that "good enough" is often exactly good enough.

Your manager will be impressed by how fast you deliver. Your teammates will wonder how you do it. And you'll have more time for the parts of programming that are actually fun.

The secret isn't working harder. It's working on the right things and knowing when to stop.
