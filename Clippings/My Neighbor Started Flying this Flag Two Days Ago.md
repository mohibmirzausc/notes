> I’m the daughter of a WWII veteran who served in Normandy, the Bulge, and helped to liberate Langenstein. My uncle was a guard at the trials of Nuremberg. I served in the U.S. military because of what I learned from my Dad and his brothers (6 total fought in WWII). I dedicated my life to protecting this nation and all Americans.
