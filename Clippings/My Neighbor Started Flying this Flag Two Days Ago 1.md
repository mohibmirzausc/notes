> I’m the daughter of a WWII veteran who served in Normandy, the Bulge, and helped to liberate Langenstein. My uncle was a guard at the trials of Nuremberg. I served in the U.S. military because of what I learned from my Dad and his brothers (6 total fought in WWII). I dedicated my life to protecting this nation and all Americans.

> Your neighbor is piece of shit for flying that flag, and also woefully misguided. You should bring a couple of the older veterans here from Ohio to sit down and explain why flying that flag in lieu of our American flag is an issue.

> If they are flying this solo, this means that their affiliation is with the Nazi and them only. That person is not American and should face deportation, per the current administration.
