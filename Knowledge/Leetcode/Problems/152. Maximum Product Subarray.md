# 152. Maximum Product Subarray

## Problem
You are given an integer array `nums`.  
Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the **largest product**, and return that product.  

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.  

---

### Examples
**Example 1**  
Input: `nums = [2,3,-2,4]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation: The subarray `[2,3]` has the largest product `6`.  

**Example 2**  
Input: `nums = [-2,0,-1]`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation: The result cannot be `2`, because `[-2,-1]` is not a contiguous subarray.  

---

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`  
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`  
- The product of any subarray of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit integer**.
