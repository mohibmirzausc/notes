# 53. Maximum Subarray

## Problem
You are given an integer array `nums`.  
Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the **largest sum**, and return that sum.

---

### Examples
**Example 1**  
Input: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation: The subarray `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum `6`.  

**Example 2**  
Input: `nums = [1]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: The subarray `[1]` has the largest sum `1`.  

**Example 3**  
Input: `nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]`  
Output: `23`  
Explanation: The subarray `[5,4,-1,7,8]` has the largest sum `23`.  

---

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`  
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`  

---

### Follow-up
If you have solved the **O(n)** solution, try implementing a **divide-and-conquer approach**, which is more subtle.
